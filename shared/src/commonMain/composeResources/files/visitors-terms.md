The KotlinConf of 2025 takes place in the Bella Center Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark (“premises”) between May 21 \- 23, 2025\. Please read these General Terms and Conditions for Visitors carefully before visiting and entering the premises of KotlinConf. By visiting KotlinConf and entering the premises, you are entering into a legal agreement with JetBrains Expo B.V., with its registered address at Gelrestraat 16, 1079 MZ Amsterdam, the Netherlands, registered with the Dutch Chamber of Commerce under the number: 74098896, VAT ID number: NL 85977129 (“JetBrains”, “we”), and you hereby agree to abide by these Terms. Nothing in these Terms limits any rights a consumer might have under applicable consumer protection laws.

## Definitions

In addition to the definitions specified above, the following definitions are used throughout these General Terms and Conditions for Visitors:

* **Ticket.** Any entrance or activity ticket that provides access to KotlinConf. Tickets are divided into: **Conference Ticket(s)**, which only provide regular admission to the conference and **Workshop Ticket(s)**, which provide access to one pre-selected workshop and the regular admission to the conference.
* **Visitor.** Any person who enters the premises at which KotlinConf is held and participates in the event.
* **Group** and **Group Visit.** A group of visitors who visit KotlinConf as a group.
* **Organizer.** An individual, company, or institution who/which organized or organizes Group Visits.
* **Website.** Any website that is the property of JetBrains s.r.o., including but not limited to everything hosted under the domains listed at [https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/websites/](https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/websites/).

These General Terms and Conditions for Visitors shall apply to any visit to and all Visitors to KotlinConf.

The applicability of these General Terms and Conditions for Visitors shall be without prejudice to the potential applicability of other contractual terms and conditions and/or regulations applied by JetBrains, such as the Terms of Use, and other terms published on the Website from time to time.

## Entrance admission

Visitors are given access to KoltinConf upon the presentation of a valid Ticket or valid ID at the entrance and upon the condition that they take into account our [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). Furthermore, if a Student Discount was used during the purchase of the Ticket the Visitor will need to provide a valid academic ID together with the valid Ticket or valid ID. You can print your Ticket or present it on a mobile device at the entrance.

For the avoidance of doubt, please be aware that on May 21, 2025 the workshops shall be held while the conference shall be held on May 22 \- 23, 2025\. If you have purchased a Workshop Ticket this gives you access to attend your pre-selected workshop on May 21, 2025 and provides regular admission to the conference, if you have purchased the Conference Ticket this means you can’t attend the workshops but shall only receive regular admission to the conference.

JetBrains reserves the right to refuse admission to Visitors if it determines, in its sole discretion, that the Visitor poses a threat to the health and/or safety of other Visitors or the staff of KotlinConf and/or the safety of the premises, our partners and the event in general.

## Your visit to KotlinConf

If you violate these General Terms and Conditions for Visitors and/or act in violation of directions and instructions given by our staff (to you), in any way, we may, in our sole discretion, decide to refuse subsequent admission to KotlinConf. In such an event, we will not be obligated to compensate for any damages or to refund the Ticket.
