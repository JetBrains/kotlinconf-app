Kotlin Kodee was on a mission. The world needed a **truly seamless** multi-platform experience, and they had the perfect toolkit: **Compose Multiplatform and Ktor.**

With one codebase, their app ran **everywhere**â€”Android, iOS, desktop, web, and even on smart fridges (because why not?).

Developers gathered to witness the magic. The UI was smooth, the performance unmatched, and the Ktor backend lightning fast. A single function call deployed the app **across all platforms effortlessly.**

Meanwhile, in another corner of the world, a Flutter developer struggled.  
*"Why is my app 300MB just to show a button?"* they whispered, as tears fell onto their YAML files.

Kodee grinned. The Kotlin ecosystem had done it.

The dream of **one Kotlin-powered future** was no longer a dream.

It was reality.
